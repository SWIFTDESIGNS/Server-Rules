        <h1><u>Server Rules</u></h1>
        <ol>
            <li>[1]Microphone - A microphone is required to play on this server. If you join and are attempting to RP without one you will be kicked. If you are having issues with your microphone, please come to the Discord and try to gain assistance in getting it to work by one of our members or one of our staff team.</li>
            <li>[2]RDM - RDM stands for Random Death Match which refers to the killing of a person without proper initiation within the RP. Initiation lasts for 5 minutes unless the scene is actively going for longer. Drive-by shootings are also considered to be RDM unless proper initiation was administered beforehand.</li>
            <li>[3]Racial and Homophobic Slurs - Racial and Homophobic Slurs are not allowed in any capacity in-game nor in Discord. If you have questions regarding what words I am referring to here and would like further clarification on what words are allowed and what words are not allowed, please feel free to DM me on Discord: Davis#0125.</li>
            <li>[4]Member Disrespect - Member Disrespect will not be tolerated whatsoever. Keep conversations civil and do not start drama.</li>
            <li>[5]Drama - BCCRP has a strict NO DRAMA policy and people who intentionally start drama within the community will be dealt with accordingly.</li>
            <li>[6]Server Disrespect - Server Disrespect will not be tolerated. If you have an issue with our server, please report it on the forums, in my DMs, or keep it to yourself. We aim to have a high tier community where everyone can come and enjoy themselves so we will not take suggestions lightly.</li>
            <li>[7]Mini Modding - Mini modding is the act of attempting to perform staff duties when you are not staff.This includes verbally disciplining rule breakers, telling people that they are breaking rules, or taking matters into your own hands.</li>
            <li>[8]Meta Gaming - Meta Gaming is the act of using scripts, tags, or any other server wide element to your advantage within an RP. This includes using a person's identification number through walls to pre-fire them, calling people names that you haven't been told in RP, and stream sniping.</li>
            <li>[9]Power Gaming - Power Gaming is the act of altering an RP scenario that it can only work out in your favor and to your wishes. RP scenarios must be able to be ran out with equal contribution from each side within the scenario. You are allowed to plan out scenarios before you perform them but in the moment if something does not go exactly as you planned you still need to go through with it.</li>
            <li>[10]Combat Logging - Combat logging is the act of leaving the server, respawning, reviving, or abusing any other methods to avoid an RP scenario or a staff sit. If caught doing so, disciplinary actions will be taken. If you have to leave your PC immediately, please do so as IRL duties come first but if you have the time, please excuse yourself while remaining in character.</li>
            <li>[11]Malicious RP - Malicious RP is not allowed whatsoever. This includes Rape RP, incredibly sadistic RPs, or killing pets without ample reason to do so. This will result in an immediate ban. Jokes regarding any of the aforementioned topics will result in a ban as well.</li>
            <li>[12]Terrorist RP - If you would like to RP as a terrorist, you have come to the wrong server. This will not be tolerated in any form be it domestic, state, international, etc. This will result in an immediate ban. Jokes regarding terrorism will result in a ban as well.</li>
            <li>[13]Value of Life - VoL refers to RPing in a way similar to how you would react in real life in the case that you were in danger. If you are in a situation without a clear way out, go with the situation. This includes being outnumbered, having a gun to the back of your head, being kidnapped, etc. If you are at a bad standpoint within the scenario, go with it as if your life depended on it.</li>
            <li>[14]New Life Rule - NLR means that if you are declared dead at a scene or in an RP scenario, you can not return to that RP scenario for 15 minutes. If the scene runs over the allotted 15 minutes, you may return as a different persona with a different story. If the scenario moves locations within the allotted 15 minutes and you just so happen to get caught up in the scenario.</li>
